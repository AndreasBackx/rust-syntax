    # patterns:
    #   - include: '#something'
    #   - include: '#somethingelse'
repository:
  # - include: '#keywords'
  # - include: '#strings'
# repo section contains a dict of items you can include elsewhere
# move items to the repo only after you've included them

# so under patterns above you'd have
#   -
#     comment: documentation comments
#     name: comment.line.documentation.rust
#     match: ^\s*///.*
# but the same section under repo would be
#   docComments:
#     comment: documentation comments
#     name: comment.line.documentation.rust
#     match: ^\s*///.*
# and then you would
#   include: '#docComments'

# plain comments //
# documentation comments ///
# that #[stuff] should have its own scope, it's comment-like

# keywords for control flow
# keyword operators
# special keywords like crate

# true declared constants
# numeric constants, unicode values, hex, octal, binary
# language constants - self or __module__-like things
